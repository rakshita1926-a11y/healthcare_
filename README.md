## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to simulate a **blockchain-based healthcare record system** where:

* Doctors can securely log in
* Patient records are stored as **blocks**
* Data integrity is maintained using **hashing**
* Any tampering is **detected instantly**

---

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ 🔐 User Authentication (Login & Signup)
✅ 🧱 Blockchain-based Data Storage
✅ 📊 Dashboard with Statistics
✅ 🔍 Search Patient Records
✅ ✏️ Edit / Update Records
✅ 🗑️ Delete Records *(for demo purposes)*
✅ 🔐 Blockchain Validation (Tamper Detection)
✅ 🌍 Web-based UI (Accessible Anywhere)

---

## 🧬 How Blockchain is Used

Each patient record is stored as a **block** containing:

* Patient ID
* Diagnosis
* Treatment
* Timestamp
* Previous Hash
* Current Hash

### 🔗 Chain Integrity

Each block is linked to the previous block using hashing, ensuring:

* ❌ No data tampering
* ✅ Data transparency
* 🔐 High security

---

## ⚠️ Note on Editing & Deletion

* In real blockchain systems, data is **immutable**
* In this project:

  * Edit/Delete is allowed for **demonstration**
  * Any modification will break the chain integrity
  * The system detects this using validation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Database:** JSON (File-based)
* **Concept Used:** Blockchain (Hash Linking)
